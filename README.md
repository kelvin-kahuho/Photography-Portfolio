# Photography Portfolio

This project is a photography portfolio website that showcases your photography work. It utilizes Express.js as the backend framework to handle server-side logic and serves static files, while the frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website allows you to display your photographs in an organized manner and provides a user-friendly interface for visitors to browse and explore your portfolio.

# Features

1. Display a collection of photographs organized in different categories or albums.
2. Each photograph can be viewed individually in a larger size or within a gallery.
3. Provide a description or caption for each photograph to provide context or additional information.
4. Implement a contact form to allow visitors to get in touch with you for inquiries or bookings.
5. Incorporate a responsive design to ensure optimal viewing experience across different devices.
